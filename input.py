#An input is simple. 

input("Enter your name: ")

#THis will ask the user to enter their name. But after this is over, the data is not saved! We can make a variable into an input:

Num = input("Enter a number: ")

#Sometimes, we want just an integer (like the example above. The user could enter a k!
#So, we can make an input an integer:

Num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
